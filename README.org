Launch applications via ivy interface. Currently supports OS X and Linux (not
tested yet). In order to use it you might want to configure some variables like
~counsel-apps-location~, ~counsel-apps-patter~ and ~counsel-app-launch-cmd~. Refer to
their documentation for more information. After that just call ~counsel-app~ to
select application to launch. This function also allows you to open specific
file in chosen application via ivy actions.
